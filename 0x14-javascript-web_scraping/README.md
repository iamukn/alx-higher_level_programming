The fs or File system module allows for writing and reading a file in javascript
fs.readFile() == reads a file
fs.writeFile() == writes to a file


readFile takes 3 arguments, the first is the file you want to read, the second is the encoding and the third is a call back function

writefile takes 4 argument, the file to write to, the content to write, the encoding and the callback.
